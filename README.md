# Cryptocurrencies


Accountability Accounting wants to offera new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.
My job is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how 
they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To group the 
cryptocurrencies I will use a clustering algorithm and add data visualizations to share the findings
with the board.

Deliverables:

    Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
    Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
    Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
    Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
